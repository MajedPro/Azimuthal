There are four ways of specifying the location, 3 of which involve
knowing your latitude &amp; longitude. If you don't know, this <a
href="http://f6fvy.free.fr/qthLocator/fullScreen.php">QTH locator</a>
can help you find your Maidenhead grid square or
latitude/longitude. The first way is to use a <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maidenhead_Locator_System">Maidenhead
grid square</a>. Using this approach, you would enter
<code>FN31pr</code> to get a map centered on <a
href="http://www.arrl.org/">ARRL</a> headquarters. For a map around
Acton, London (where I once had the pleasure of living), enter
<code>IO91um</code>.  Washington DC is <code>FM18lv</code>.
</p>
<p>
The second way is to use a latitude/longitude pair as two real numbers
separated by a comma. A positive number for latitude means north, and
a negative value means south. For longitude, negative means west, and
positive means east. Using this approach, you would enter
<code>41.714775, -72.727260</code> for <a
href="http://www.arrl.org/">ARRL</a> headquarters, and the London
example is <code>51.50471, -0.26781</code>.
</p>
<p>
The third approach involves entering the latitude/longitude in
degrees, minutes, and seconds. Enter up to three natural numbers
separated by spaces followed by a character indicating north or south
for latitude. Longitude is up to three space separated by spaces
followed by a character indicating east or west. For <a
href="http://www.arrl.org/">ARRL</a> headquarters, enter <code>41 42
53N 72 43 38W</code>, and for Acton, London, enter <code>51 30 17N 0
16 4W</code>.
</p>

<p>
  The fourth way is the enter a city name. For big cities like
  Chicago, Paris, and London, you can enter the city name all by
  itself. For smaller US cities, enter the city comma state (e.g.,
  "Pittsburgh, PA").  For non-US cities, enter the city comma country
  (e.g., "Caracas, Venezuela").
